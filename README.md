# Coriolis Effect

## What is Coriolis Effect?

Long version: https://scijinks.gov/coriolis/  
Short version: objects go left when we rotate left

### Why would I care?

This phenomenon has some surprising effects on the Earth's atmosphere. It influences weather on a large scale and
therefore can be interesting for pilots, mariners and weather enthusiasts out there. Go check the (long
version)[https://scijinks.gov/coriolis] for more!

## What is this project?

This is a simple demonstration of the Coriolis effect made using Godot Game Engine.  
You can change the rotation speed and the throw strength to get an intuition for the effect.

### Why do I care again (as a software dev)?

- You can learn how to create objects with 3D physics.
- You can find an example on how to use the *_integrate_forces* function to influence Rigid body without breaking the
  Engine. For instance, how to teleport a Rigid Body object.
- Or maybe you just want to explore some simple Godot project IDK lol.

## Build and Run

Download latest Godot and import the project.
